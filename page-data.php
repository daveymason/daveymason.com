                            <p>On the contact form you are asked for your first name and an e-mail address. This is all that is needed, no need to send me a full name, phone number or anything else. </p>

                            <p>With a server hosted in Amsterdam there will be no worries about your data leaving the EU. All fonts are also downloaded onto the server, so the site itself will not need to contact the Google fonts API. </p>
